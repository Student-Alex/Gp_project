            <p>Mental well-being is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life,
                realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral
                component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make
                decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And
                it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development.</p>

            <p>Phyisical activity is one of the three key factors that play a role in the mental well-being of someone.
                According to the CDC <b>30</b> minutes of physical activity a day should be accomplished to have a
                healthy lifestyle. Being active releases chemicals in your brain that make you feel good - boosting your
                self-esteem and helping you concentrate as well as sleep well and feel better </p>

            <div class="Textcolum"> How to get more active? </div>
            <p>
                habit:
                being more active can simply be a matter of spending more time on the things you already like doing,
                such as gardening or taking the dog for a walk. The best motivator for getting active and staying active
                is to do something that
                you enjoy. The more you enjoy it the likelier you are to keep it up. Some examples to start being more
                active are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> join a local sport, recreation or fitness club </li>
                <li> meet a friend for a walk or a bike ride </li>
                <li> park the car and walk the rest of the way </li>
                <li> take the stairs</li>
                <li> walk and talk with a friend for half an hour before going for a coffee </li>
                <li> get back to a sport or activity that you used to enjoy. </li>

            <div class="Textcolum"> Sleep problems:</div>
            <p>
                Insomnia
                Insomnia is characterized by an inability to initiate or maintain sleep. It may also take the form of
                early morning awakening in which the
                individual awakens several hours early and is unable to resume sleeping. Difficulty initiating or
                maintaining sleep may often manifest itself
                as excessive daytime sleepiness, which characteristically results in functional impairment throughout
                the day. Before arriving at a diagnosis
                of primary insomnia, the healthcare provider will rule out other potential causes, such as other sleep
                disorders, side effects of medications,
                substance abuse, depression, or other previously undetected illness. Chronic psychophysiological
                insomnia (or 'learned' or 'conditioned' insomnia)
                may result from a stressor combined with fear of being unable to sleep. Individuals with this condition
                may sleep better when not in their own
                beds. Health care providers may treat chronic insomnia with a combination of use of sedative-hypnotic or
                sedating antidepressant medications,
                along with behavioral techniques to promote regular sleep.</p>

            <p>

                Narcolepsy
                Excessive daytime sleepiness (including episodes of irresistible sleepiness) combined with sudden muscle
                weakness are the hallmark signs of narcolepsy. The sudden muscle weakness seen in narcolepsy may be
                elicited by strong emotion or surprise. Episodes of narcolepsy have been described as 'sleep attacks'
                and may occur in unusual circumstances, such as walking and other forms of physical activity. The
                healthcare provider may treat narcolepsy with stimulant medications combined with behavioral
                interventions, such as regularly scheduled naps, to minimize the potential disruptiveness of narcolepsy
                on the individual's life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
                RLS is characterized by an unpleasant 'creeping' sensation, often feeling like it is originating in the
                lower legs, but often associated with aches and pains throughout the legs. This often causes difficulty
                initiating sleep and is relieved by movement of the leg, such as walking or kicking. Abnormalities in
                the neurotransmitter dopamine have often been associated with RLS. Healthcare providers often combine a
                medication to help correct the underlying dopamine abnormality along with a medicine to promote sleep
                continuity in the treatment of RLS.
            </p>
            <p> Sleep Apnea
                Snoring may be more than just an annoying habit - it may be a sign of sleep apnea. Persons with sleep
                apnea characteristically make periodic gasping or 'snorting' noises, during which their sleep is
                momentarily interrupted. Those with sleep apnea may also experience excessive daytime sleepiness, as
                their sleep is commonly interrupted and may not feel restorative. Treatment of sleep apnea is dependent
                on its cause. If other medical problems are present, such as congestive heart failure or nasal
                obstruction, sleep apnea may resolve with treatment of these conditions. Gentle air pressure
                administered during sleep (typically in the form of a nasal continuous positive airway pressure device)
                may also be effective in the treatment of sleep apnea. As interruption of regular breathing or
                obstruction of the airway during sleep can pose serious health complications, symptoms of sleep apnea
                should be taken seriously. Treatment should be sought from a health care provider.
            </p>
            <div class="Textcolum"> How to improve sleep health? </div>
            Some habits that can improve your sleep health:

            <p>Be consistent, go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including
                on the weekends</p>
            <p>Make sure your bedroom is quiet, dark, relaxing, and at a comfortable temperature</p>
            <p> Remove electronic devices, such as TVs, computers, and smart phones, from the bedroom</p>
            <p>Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime </p>
            <p> And most important, all elements from mental well-being are intertwined. Being physically active during
                the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.

            <p>
                Taking care of your wellbeing can help you feel more able to manage stress. Different things will work
                for different people, but these are some ideas you could try:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Be kind to yourself. </li>
                <p> Learning to be kinder to yourself can help with how you feel in different
                    situations. Try to take breaks in your day for things you enjoy. And reward yourself for your
                    achievements, even if they seem small.</p>
                <li> Try to find time to relax. </li>
                <p> This might feel hard if you can't do anything to stop a situation that is
                    making you stressed. But if you can allow yourself a short break, this can help with how you feel.
                </p>
                <li> Develop your interests and hobbies. </li>
                <p> Spending time on things you enjoy could help distract you from a
                    stressful situation. If stress is making you feel lonely or isolated, shared hobbies can also be a
                    good
                    way to meet new people.</p>
                <li> Spend time in nature. </li>
                <p> This can help to reduce stress and improve wellbeing. You could try going for a
                    walk in a green space, taking care of indoor plants, or spending time with animals.</p>
                <li> Look after your physical health.</li>
                <p> Getting enough sleep, staying physically active and eating a balanced
                    diet can make stress easier to manage. Stress can sometimes make these things difficult to look
                    after.
                    But even small changes can make a big difference.</p>
